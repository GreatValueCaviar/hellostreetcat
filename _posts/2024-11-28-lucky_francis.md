 In the hyperstitized Turtle Island Expansion of Hello Street, there is a charming kitten named Lucky Francis. Lucky Francis was a brown tabby kitten aproximately 3 weeks old.

Lucky Francis was taken in by the caretakers of the Birichino Buffet, a beloved feeding spot where cats from all around would gather to enjoy a meal, after being found alone in a nearby field. However, Lucky Francis was not in good health. Their eyes were shut and they were so weak, it was clear Lucky Francis would need some extra care to get healthy. The day after being found, the caretakers sought help from the local shelter and transferred Lucky Francis to their care. As of May 21st, Francis has been recovering well and is now in the foster care of a new caretaker with the intention of being adopted.
