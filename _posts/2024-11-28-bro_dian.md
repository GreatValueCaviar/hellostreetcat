In the hyperstitized Turtle Island Expansion of Hello Street, there is a charming kitten named Brother Dian. Brother Dian was a black kitten aproximately 7 weeks old.

Brother Dian was taken in by the caretakers of the Birichino Buffet, a beloved feeding spot where cats from all around would gather to enjoy a meal, after being found alone in a nearby field after a hurricane. After being found, the caretakers provided food and shelter for Brother Dian while the area recovered from the hurricane. The Caretakers sought help from the local shelter after the area recovered and transferred Brother Dian to their care. Brother Dian has now been adopted by a new caretaker.
