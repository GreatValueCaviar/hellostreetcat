    <h1>The Gluttonous Beast of Hello Street</h1>
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streetcatlove/hellostreetcat/main/img/gluttonous_beast.png">
    <p>Within the bustling streets of Shanghai on Hello Street, there lived a cat known far and wide as "the gluttonous beast." This cat was an orange bi-color ticked tabby, with big orange patches and a small one closest to his head. He has a shorter tail and a rounder appearance. But what truly set him apart was his insatiable appetite for kibble.</p>
    <p>He has had many documented instances of consuming kibble at a fast rate averaging 2-3 munches per second. He typically dines anywhere from a few minutes, ending due to interruption from other cats, up to the current record he has set at a whopping 25 minutes of straight feasting.</p>
    <p>However, the gluttonous beast's passion for consumption wasn't without its challenges. He had a difficult relationship with Ms. Kirby, a feisty calico who dominated many of the felines on Hello Street. Their encounters resulted in slaps, sometimes ending the Beast's attempts to break his previous records. Though there have been times he has continued dining after these altercations, driven by his desire to maintain control over Mt. Kibbles ever-changing height.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, he had more neutral relationships with cats like Mr. Fresh, who has been spotted in the background during a feast. The gluttonous beast was somewhat patient with other cats, allowing them to eat or leaving when another feline approached. But when his appetite took precedence, he didn't hesitate to let other cats wait for him to finish.</p>
    <p>Despite his size, which continued to increase as he grew from a kitten, the gluttonous beast remained cautious of other cats' presence, especially those like Ms. Rust and Mr. Beef, with whom he had challenged relationships involving hisses and slaps.</p>
    <p>And so, the legend of the gluttonous beast grew on Hello Street, not just for his savant-like kibble consumption but also for the tales of his encounters with other cats, showcasing both his feisty nature and his voracious appetite.</p>
